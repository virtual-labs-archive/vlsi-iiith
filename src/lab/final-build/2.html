					 <p>Physical distances and the lack of resources make us unable to perform experiments, especially when they involve sophisticated instruments. Also, good teachers are always a scarce resource. Web-based and video-based courses address the issue of teaching to some extent. Conducting joint experiments by two participating institutions and also sharing costly resources has always been a challenge. With the present day internet and computer technologies the above limitations can no more hamper students and researchers in enhancing their skills and knowledge. Also, in a country such as ours, costly instruments and equipment need to be shared with fellow researchers to the extent possible.</p>
<p>The armature of the DC motor is fed from a (controlled) three phase thyristor rectifier. The DC voltage to motor field is also provided by a similar controlled rectifier. All the interconnections of the components are made inside the panel. A measurement card is enclosed inside the panel, which is used to measure and scale down the voltages and currents of the motor and generator.</p>

					<p>The setup consists of a controlled prime mover (DC motor - separately excited) coupled to a synchronous generator which is to be connected to a power grid. The synchronous generator is excited by a controlled AC-DC power electronic converter. A separately excited DC motor is used as a prime mover. The armature of the DC motor is fed from a (controlled) three phase thyristor rectifier. The DC voltage to motor field is also provided by a similar controlled rectifier. All the interconnections of the components are made inside the panel.<p>

					<p>QNX is a commercial Unix-like real-time operating system, aimed primarily at the embedded systems. As a microkernel-based OS, QNX is based on the idea of running most of the OS in the form of a number of small tasks, known as servers. This differs from the more traditional monolithic kernel, in which the operating system is a single very large program composed of a huge number of "parts" with special abilities.</p>
